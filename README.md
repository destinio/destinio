```
"You want to recruit people?"

"Not exactly. 

Though if I found good people, 
I would certainly try to bring them in. 

I want to take your recruits and find missions for them. 

I want to be the one who listens to what people need,
who finds out what people can do and then helps them do it."

―Ahsoka Tano to Bail Organa
```

"You want to recruit people?"

"Not exactly. Though if I found good people, I would certainly try to bring them in. I want to take your recruits and find missions for them. I want to be the one who listens to what people need, who finds out what people can do and then helps them do it."
―Bail Organa and Ahsoka Tano
